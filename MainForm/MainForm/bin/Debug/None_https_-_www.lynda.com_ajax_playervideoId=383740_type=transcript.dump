sense\r\nto bring this up slightly\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:00:16.08]","Caption":"so that that can be the point\r\nwhere the neck will bend.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:00:21.04]","Caption":"So I'll bring that up\r\na little bit like so.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:00:23.05]","Caption":"Now select Extrude.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:00:26.09]","Caption":"And I'm going to drop that.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:00:29.03]","Caption":"Again, that same thinking\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:00:31.02]","Caption":"of where do I want that head to rotate at?\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:00:35.08]","Caption":"We can bring that down a little bit.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:00:39.00]","Caption":"And then now,

like so.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:01:12.09]","Caption":"And then Extrude this down\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:01:15.07]","Caption":"so as to create a hip

do\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:01:24.06]","Caption":"is start doing the joints for the legs.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:01:27.04]","Caption":"Because of the fact that those are offset,\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:01:29.06]","Caption":"I'm gonna create them as a separate chain.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:01:32.06]","Caption":"And so, I'll go here to my right view\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:01:36.03]","Caption":"and pan up a little.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:01:38.04]","Caption":"And I'm gonna start a new\r\nbone, so I'm gonna select add.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:01:43.00]","Caption":"And then I can change the position of this\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:01:46.04]","Caption":"to be based on where I want\r\nthat leg to be set up,

is\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:02:03.00]","Caption":"so that when we set up\r\nthe inverse kinematics\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:02:07.03]","Caption":"to make the leg move\r\nthe way we want it to,\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:02:10.04]","Caption":"because that knee is slightly forward,\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:02:12.01]","Caption":"that encourages the IK to know to bend in\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:02:16.01]","Caption":"that direction first and foremost.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:02:19.02]","Caption":"So I'm gonna select Extrude

where\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:02:29.03]","Caption":"that ball of that foot will be.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:02:31.06]","Caption":"And Extrude one more

degrees.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:03:19.02]","Caption":"Then have it come out like so.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:03:23.01]","Caption":"This bone, I want to stay pivoted

forward.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:03:31.08]","Caption":"I'm gonna go ahead and select this joint\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:03:34.02]","Caption":"and I'm gonna select Parent,\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:03:35.08]","Caption":"Clear Parent, Disconnect Bone.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:03:39.07]","Caption":"And that way I can move this\r\nbone a little farther
