that\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:03:08.03]","Caption":"is that I'm going to select\r\nthis bone here, the lower leg,\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:03:12.00]","Caption":"and switch to Pose

that,\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:05.01]","Caption":"that the orientation\r\nlooks a little funny here.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:07.06]","Caption":"If I rotate this, then the issue\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:10.06]","Caption":"is that I simply need to fix that rotation\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:14.07]","Caption":"but one other thing that I want to do\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:16.07]","Caption":"is I want the Chain\r\nLength to be a value of 2\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:21.01]","Caption":"and the reason for that is\r\nbecause from that IK Target,\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:24.08]","Caption":"I want these two bones, the two leg bones,\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:28.07]","Caption":"to be the ones affected.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:30.04]","Caption":"You'll notice that when\r\nI changed that to 2,\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:32.04]","Caption":"this corrected itself\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:33.05]","Caption":"because it no longer considered\r\nitself part of that chain.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:37.01]","Caption":"To fix the orientation\r\nof the pole constraint,\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:40.03]","Caption":"I have this control, Pole\r\nAngle, and you'll notice\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:42.07]","Caption":"that as I rotate it back\r\ntowards the middle again,\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:46.03]","Caption":"right around -90,\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:48.03]","Caption":"is going to bring that\r\nright back to the front\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:51.04]","Caption":"which we have now.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:53.00]","Caption":"So now, we have a solution\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:55.00]","Caption":"that allows us to have\r\na leg that can be bent.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:04:58.07]","Caption":"For example, if I grab this\r\nupper leg and I move it around,\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:05:03.07]","Caption":"you'll see that the foot does\r\nnot go through the floor.\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:05:07.06]","Caption":"However, you'll notice that it\r\ndoes rotate around the ground\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:05:13.02]","Caption":"and so in the next lesson,\r\nwe're going to show\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:05:15.09]","Caption":"how to create more bones\r\nto lock down that foot\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:05:19.07]","Caption":"and control it in many different ways\r\n\r\n"},{"Timecode":"[00:05:22.01]","Caption":"for what we'll
